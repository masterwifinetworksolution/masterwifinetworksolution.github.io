## Step 2: Obtain the Xbox BIOS and MCPX ROM

1. The Xbox BIOS and MCPX ROM are necessary for the emulator to function. They include the essential firmware to run Xbox games.
2. Due to legal reasons, we can't provide direct links to these files. However, you can legally obtain them from your own Xbox console.
3. Once you have the BIOS and MCPX ROM files, place them in a dedicated folder on your PC.

## Step 3: Install the Emulator

2. Navigate to the folder where you placed the Xbox BIOS and MCPX ROM files and select them.
3. The BIOS and MCPX ROM will be installed, enabling the emulator to run Xbox games.

## Step 5: Configure the Emulator

1. Go to the configuration settings in Xemu to adjust the settings according to your system's capabilities.
2. Configure the graphics settings to optimize performance.
3. Similarly, configure the audio and input settings to suit your preferences.

## Step 6: Load and Play Xbox Games

1. Obtain your Xbox game ISOs. Ensure these are legally obtained copies of games you own.
2. Go to the game loading section in Xemu.
3. Navigate to the location of your game ISO and select it.
4. The game should now start running, allowing you to enjoy your favorite Xbox titles.
